**Docker. Part 1**

*Aim: Build app in docker image*

1. Fork the repository
2. Write dockerfile
3. Build app in docker image
4. Run the container & check its work
5. Open pull request


*Notes: (not necessary but useful)*

*   Think about which base image you use and what you put in it. Mind that the final image should be as small as possible
*   Try to run application inside a container as non root
*   Look at usage virtual environment in order to install python packages
